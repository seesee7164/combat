Description: A goblin scout.

victory: The goblin falls to your feet, dead.

persuasion: Congratulations! Through flawless reasoning you convince the goblin that it would do better  waiting for a weaker traveler to pass by. The goblin lets you go and shares some gold for the advice.

run: Congratulations! Like a wuss, you have somehow escaped one puny goblin who, in your wussness, you did not believe you could defeat. Again, congratulations!

rob: On the goblin you find some trinkets to line your pockets with.

death: You fall to the ground, dead, as the goblin eagerly steps up to loot your corpse.
